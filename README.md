### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nate, I go by TerrorByte or variations online (TerrrorByte, TerrorByteTW, etc.). I'm a tech enthusiast who has never had a job in Software Development, yet it's literally one of my favorite things to do ðŸ˜œ

I mainly write in Type/JavaScript and Java, but love learning other languages too!

## Let's Hang!

I stream games (and sometimes programming) on Twitch Tuesdays and Saturdays at 8:30 PM CST. If you want to vibe with us, check us out below ðŸ˜„
