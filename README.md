### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nate, I go by TerrorByte or variations online (TerrrorByte, TerrorByteTW, etc.). I am a Software Engineer working in Unified Communications and a huge tech enthusiast!

I mainly write in Type/JavaScript and Java, but love learning other languages too!

## Let's Hang!

I stream games (and sometimes programming) on Twitch Saturdays at 12:00 PM CST and Sundays at 1:30 PM CST. If you want to vibe with us, check us out below ðŸ˜„
