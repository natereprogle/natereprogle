# Public Key Repository

This folder is specifically for storing my public keys for public use. Three keys are currently stored here:

  1. My PGP key, used for secure communication and sometimes commit signing
  2. My current SSH key, using Ed25519. It's also used for commit signing, and has largely replaced my PGP key for the most part
  3. My old SSH key, using RSA

If you have any questions, please [send me an email](mailto:nate@reprogle.org). If you suspect abuse of these keys, please [click here](mailto:nate@reprogle.org?subject=Public%20Key%20Abuse&body=I%20suspect%20your%20public%20key%20is%20being%20abused%20and%20used%20for%20purposes%20not%20originally%20intended.%0AName%3A%0A%0ACompany%20%28If%20applicable%29%3A%0A%0AAbuse%20Type%3A%0A%0APlease%20provide%20additional%20info%20%28If%20possible%29%3A%0A%0A) (This is a `mailto` link & will automatically fill the subject and body in.
